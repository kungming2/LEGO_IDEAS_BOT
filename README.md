## About LEGO_IDEAS_BOT

LEGO_IDEAS_BOT is a simple Reddit bot (running under the username u/LEGO_IDEAS_BOT) that services various Reddit LEGO communities on with a simple comment that includes:

* The name of the set
* The author of the set
* An image of the set 
* A short description of the set by its author (3 sentences or 500 words, whichever is shorter)
* How many supporters the set has
* How many days remaning in the set's campaign
* A footer message reminding people to vote for the set if they like it.

#### Origin

This bot was written as a response to a request of u/rock99rock at r/RequestABot. I do not frequently update the bot's code as I wrote it at a stage where my Python knowledge was pretty elementary and basic. Rather, I update the bot just enough to maintain compatibility with the site and to correct for any issues that might occur.

#### Notes

LEGO_IDEAS_BOT is also notably the only Reddit bot that I've written that does not respond to an explicit user command, and instead replies to a pre-determined string (in this case, an Ideas link). However, LEGO_IDEAS_BOT is not a simple reply_bot like the many novelty comment bots that plague Reddit, as it:

* Has the explicit permission of the mods of the main community it runs on (r/LEGO)
* Does not post more than once on the same link per thread
* Does not run on r/all, but rather, only on LEGO-related communities
* Provides useful information in its response
* Contains contact information for its creator in every comment

It is telling, I think, that this bot got several dozen "good bot" comments during the period the bot vote tallier u/GoodBot_BadBot was active, and *not a single* "bad bot" vote. Not that these votes are definitely indicative of anything - they're not - but the LEGO communities have responded positively to LEGO_IDEAS_BOT over the last couple of years and continue to do so.
